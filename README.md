# CENCO-MIT-Back-T1

## Project Overview üìç

This project is the backend for the User Management Platform developed for TalentAlke. The goal is to build a robust and secure backend system using NestJS to handle user management, including registration, authentication, and data management. The system uses TypeORM to interact with a MySQL database and implements JWT-based authentication.
